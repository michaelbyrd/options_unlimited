								<h3>About Options Unlimited</h3>
								<p>Since 1987, Options Unlimited has assisted people with disabilities to become as independent as possible. In the counties served by Options Unlimited, there are over 5,400 people between the ages of 16 and 64 who have disabilities and are not employed. As this population ages, it becomes more and more difficult to find them work. To help address this challenge, Options Unlimited works with high school students and adults to find appropriate employment and engage in educational and recreational activities.</p>
								<p>Currently, Options Unlimited is serving approximately 140 clients each year. To expand the number of individuals we are serving, we are reaching out to the community to ask for your support in this effort.</p>
								<p>Funding for our programs consist of support from many community partners The Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (OVR), Seven Counties Services, Medicaid Waivers - Supports for Community Living (SCL) Waiver, Michelle P. Waiver, Metro United Way, Special Grants, BINGO, donations and other fundraisers.</p>

								<h3>Adult Day Training</h3>
								<p>The Adult Day Training Program at Options Unlimited provides an opportunity for adults with developmental or intellectual disabilities to be an involved part of the community.  Individuals learn different activities of daily living, social and adaptive skills, employment skills, and self advocacy skills that are age appropriate.  Speech, Occupational, and Physical therapy services are also offered at the program. A team including the individual, caregiver, day program staff and other team members (case managers, behavior specialist) meet annually to develop a plan to individualize services and set goals for each individual.  Clients then work on their goals through the various activities out in the community as well as planned activities at the center.</p>
